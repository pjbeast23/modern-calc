## Project Description
SocialCalc, originally developed as part of the Socialtext platform, is a web-based spreadsheet application that allows collaborative editing and data manipulation. Despite its innovative approach to collaborative spreadsheets, SocialCalc has become outdated, and there is a growing need for a modern, scalable version that leverages contemporary web technologies and frameworks. 

Our project aims to redevelop SocialCalc using modern languages such as Node.js, Go, or Django. This modernization will enhance the platform's performance, security, and scalability, making it a more robust tool for collaborative data management. By integrating cutting-edge features like real-time updates, AI-driven data suggestions, and advanced data visualization, we intend to create a powerful tool that significantly improves developer productivity.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Node.js, Go, Django
- **Frontend:** React, Clerk.js
- **Real-Time Updates:** Socket.io
- **Authentication:** Clerk
- **Version Control:** GitHub
